# Security Policy

## API Keys and Sensitive Information

- All API keys in the commit history have been revoked and are no longer valid
- New API keys should never be committed directly to the repository
- Use the `.env` file for local development (which is ignored by Git)
- Follow the instructions in the README.md for setting up your environment variables

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com) rather than using the issue tracker.
